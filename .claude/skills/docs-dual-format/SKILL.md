# Dual-Format Documentation

All project documentation in `docs/` must be maintained in two parallel formats:

| Format | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Markdown | `docs/md/` | CLI-friendly, version-control diffable |
| HTML | `docs/html/` | Browser-friendly, styled with shared CSS |

## Rules

1. **Content parity**: Every `.md` file in `docs/md/` must have a corresponding `.html` file in `docs/html/` with equivalent information.
2. **Shared style**: All HTML pages reference the same `style.css` from `docs/html/style.css`.
3. **Consistent navigation**: All HTML pages share the same `<nav>` with current-page highlighting. See Navigation rules below.
4. **README documents serving**: The project README must include instructions for starting the doc server and SSH tunnel.
5. **No placeholder text**: After completion, no `docs/md/*.md` file may contain template placeholder text (e.g., "补充…", "待定义", "模块 A"). Every claim must be derived from actual repo analysis.

### Navigation rules

When total documentation pages ≤ 6, use flat `<a>` links in the `<nav>`.

When total pages > 6, group links into 2-4 dropdown menus using the `nav-dropdown` pattern:

```html
<nav>
  <span class="brand">Project Name</span>
  <a href="index.html" class="active">总览</a>
  <div class="nav-dropdown">
    <span class="nav-dropdown-trigger active">开发文档</span>
    <div class="nav-dropdown-menu">
      <a href="architecture.html" class="active">架构</a>
      <a href="implementation.html">实现</a>
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
  ...
</nav>
```

Key rules for dropdowns:
- `<span class="nav-dropdown-trigger">` gets `class="active"` when any child is the current page
- The specific active child link also gets `class="active"` (shows a dot indicator via `::before`)
- Each dropdown menu has `z-index: 1000`; the nav itself has `z-index: 100` to prevent body content from occluding the menus
- The invisible bridge (`::after` pseudo-element, 12px tall) above each menu eliminates the hover gap between trigger and menu items
- Group pages by reader concern: development docs (architecture, implementation, schemas), operations (usage, deployment, ops), design records (ADRs, roadmap, interviews)

**When the nav changes** (page added/removed/renamed), every HTML file's `<nav>` must be updated identically. Only the `class="active"` positions differ per page.

## Page structure

### Minimum baseline (mandatory for every project)

These four pages must exist after initialization. They cover the essential dimensions of any project:

| Page | File | Covers |
|------|------|--------|
| Overview | `OVERVIEW.md` | Project purpose, core metrics, current status, quick nav |
| Architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Directory tree, module responsibilities, data flow, key schemas |
| Usage | `USAGE.md` | Build / run / test commands, configuration, environment setup |
| Design Decisions | `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` | Key ADRs, why-not alternatives, tradeoffs made |

### Interactive Architecture Diagram (optional)

When the project has multiple modules spanning different languages or repos with clear data-flow phases (e.g., profiling → training → inference), the ARCHITECTURE page can include an interactive diagram with:

- **Phase buttons** — users click to switch between phases, each phase gets a distinct color (Phase 1: blue, Phase 2: purple, Phase 3: gold)
- **Canvas-animated flow lines** — dashed arrows with glowing dots that travel **sequentially step-by-step** (one step at a time, not simultaneous)
- **Step indicator panel** — DOM element showing current step label, progress bar, and per-phase colored badge, updated in sync with the animation

Use this when:
- The project has ≥2 independent modules or repos
- Data flows between them in discrete, nameable phases
- Each phase involves ≥2 steps of data handoff

Counter-constraint: do NOT use this for simple single-repo projects with trivial data flow. Use a static `flow-diagram` instead.

Template implementation:
- The `architecture.html` template contains the full Canvas animation engine (no modification needed) and placeholder data structures (`phaseSteps`, `highlightModules`, `phaseColors`) marked with `AGENT:` comments for the agent to fill from repo analysis
- All CSS classes are prefixed `arch-` and live in `style.css` under the "Interactive Architecture Diagram" comment block
- The animation engine is a state machine: `travel` (dot moves from source to target) → `pause` (completed connection held visible) → next step → cycle after all steps done
- In "全部连接" (phase 0) mode, all three phases' steps chain sequentially with their respective colors, showing the full end-to-end pipeline

### Adding pages beyond the baseline

The four core pages are a **floor, not a ceiling**. After analyzing the repo, add pages when the content warrants independent treatment. Use these heuristics to decide:

- **Independent subsystem or service** — if the repo contains multiple deployable units, each deserves its own architecture-style page
- **Non-trivial API contract or data schema** — if a reader would need to consult this regularly, give it a dedicated page
- **Multiple deployment environments** — if setup varies significantly across dev / staging / prod, split them
- **Contribution guide or testing strategy** — if these are substantial enough to be referenced independently

Counter-constraint: do NOT split for the sake of splitting, and do NOT cram unrelated topics into one giant page. The test: each page should be explainable to a new teammate as "this is the page about X."

When adding a page:
1. Create `docs/md/<SLUG>.md` with the content
2. Create `docs/html/<slug>.html` reusing the shared `<nav>` and CSS
3. Add the new page to the `<nav>` in every existing HTML page
4. Update the TOC in `docs/html/index.html`

#### Deep Interview page (optional)

When the project has recorded decision-making interviews (e.g., from OMC deep-interview sessions) or structured ADR discussions, a dedicated deep-interviews page can consolidate these into a top-down reader-friendly format.

Use the `deep-interviews.html` template with the `.di-*` CSS classes:

- `.di-layout` — flex container with sidebar + main content
- `.di-toc` — sticky sidebar table of contents (anchored per section)
- `.di-section` — each logical topic as a card
- `.di-q` / `.di-a` — Q&A pairs within each section (blue left-border for question, gold for answer/conclusion)

Content principles for this page:
- **Organize top-down, not chronologically.** Group by logical topic (concept → architecture → pipeline → evaluation), not by interview session or round number.
- **Answers are the developer's refined conclusions, not raw transcripts.** Paraphrase and restate. Keep the reasoning chain, discard conversational filler.
- **Each Q should represent a challenged assumption or a key fork in the road.** Not every interview round needs its own card — merge adjacent rounds that address the same theme.

Do NOT create this page if:
- The project has no interview/ADR records to consolidate
- All decisions are already adequately covered in DESIGN_DECISIONS.md
- The content would be a single section (one page should cover multiple themes)

## Workflow

This is a two-phase process. Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2 begins.

### Phase 1: Analyze the repo and fill docs/md/

Before writing any documentation, gather information from the actual repository:

1. **Read existing documentation sources** — `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.omc/` files, any existing `docs/` content
2. **Read manifest files** — `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Makefile`, or equivalent
3. **Map the directory tree** — identify top-level modules, their responsibilities, and how they connect
4. **Extract commands** — build, test, run, lint, deploy — from scripts, Makefile targets, CI configs, or manifest scripts
5. **Extract design rationale** — from `git log` for major architectural commits, ADR files, or CLAUDE.md context

Then produce or update `docs/md/`:

- Start with the four core files (OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, USAGE, DESIGN_DECISIONS)
- Add supplementary `.md` files for any topic that meets the heuristics above
- Every file must contain concrete, repo-specific information — no placeholder text may survive

### Phase 2: Convert docs/md/ to docs/html/

For each `.md` file in `docs/md/`, generate or update the corresponding `.html` file in `docs/html/`:

1. Use the existing HTML pages as a style reference — same `<nav>`, same `<head>` structure, same CSS class vocabulary
2. Convert Markdown content to HTML, preserving headings, code blocks, tables, lists, and links
3. Ensure the `<nav>` in every HTML file lists all current pages with correct `class="active"` on the current page
4. Update `docs/html/index.html` to include the full table of contents

## Serving docs

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 -d docs/html/
```

SSH tunnel from local machine:
```bash
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 -N user@<server>
```

## Verification checklist

Before claiming completion, verify:

- [ ] Every `.md` file has a corresponding `.html` file
- [ ] No placeholder text remains in any `docs/md/*.md` file
- [ ] All HTML pages share the same `<nav>` with correct active-page highlighting
- [ ] All HTML pages reference `style.css`
- [ ] Cross-page links work (both in MD and HTML)
- [ ] `index.html` TOC lists every page
- [ ] README includes doc serving instructions
- [ ] If using dropdown nav: hovering from trigger to menu items is gap-free (no flicker/disappear); dropdown menus are not occluded by page content (body cards, pre blocks, etc.)
- [ ] If using `.di-*` deep-interview page: content is organized top-down by topic, not chronologically; answers are refined conclusions, not raw transcripts
